# OrangeExtensions #
## A pluggable jar for the Apple Java Extensions, updated for Java 5 ##

### Overview ###
Now you can have Java 5 Apple extensions on Windows/Linux/etc without compiler errors.
Apple's official jar is for Java 4 only, so I updated it. That's it.

Source code is included for easy combination with GPL code. 
Apple forgot to include the source with their jar.
